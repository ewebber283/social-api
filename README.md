# Purpose
Make a social network api showcasing users, comments, and reactions. Use get, post, put, and delete routes to show different users and thoughts being read, created, updated, and deleted.

# Issues
There were problems with the thoughts routes as you will see in the video. It said an error when posting, yet when running get routes with users it showed the thoughts. The put and delete routes were not working as well.
